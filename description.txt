Additional note from the dev :
- This mod is wild ride, it isn't meant to be balanced, it is meant to be a "experience" so don't expect it to be very playable, and most likely 
won't be maintain unless tmod drop a new update that affect this mod code, then I will do smth about it
- I have remove some funni effect, fix a minor bug, and that pretty much it, I also change the name cause well, it felt that the name didn't made much sense

Until then, have fun dying a lot
