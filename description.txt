This mod is wild ride, it isn't meant to be balanced, it is meant to be a "experience" so don't expect it to be very playable, and most likely 
won't be maintain unless tmod drop a new update that affect this mod code or when I feel like adding idea to this mod, then I will do smth about it

Until then, have fun dying a lot
